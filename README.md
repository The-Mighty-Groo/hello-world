Learning code from level 0
I'm 52 years old, and tired of not knowing enough about computers to feel competent in their use.  Therefore, I'm using The Odin Project as a means of stimulating my intellect and my sense of adventure, while expanding my professional horizons.  I know absolutely nothing about coding, and am terrified of screwing up my computer to no good end, but whatever.  We grow through adversity; I anticipate much growth.
